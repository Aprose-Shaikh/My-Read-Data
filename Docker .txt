Deployment of microservices become diffecult
How can u deploy these microservices of different language 
thats why docker came in picture
Docker image contains jdk, paython or nodeJS

Docker image contains all the s/w , libraries are the part of it
/*********************Distributed Tracing*******************************
how do u trace the problem when multiple microservices are chained
Zipkin container - Distributed tracing server
command - docker  -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin:2.23.

HTTP. So, API Gateway, Currency Conversion services, Currency Exchange service, all of these would be sending the

information out to the Distributed Tracing Server using HTTP calls. And the distributed tracing
The information from these microservices is lost. And to prevent that from happening

what we can do is, we can have a queue in between.

We can have a queue like Rabbit MQ in between. All the microservices can send the information out to

the Rabbit MQ queue and the Distributor Tracing Server can be picking up the information from the Rabbit

MQ.

This would ensure that even if the Distributor Tracing Server is down, the microservices can keep

sending messages to Rabbit MQ. And when the Distributor Tracing Server is up, it can pick up the messages
